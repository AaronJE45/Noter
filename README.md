# Note Taking application

## A note taking application built using MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js

Users can create, delete and edit notes all while being authenticated.

This is a project that I am using to help me get started with MERN by following and adding my own twist to a youtube tutorial( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcxjCPeicvU&t=4599s )


### Changes compared to the tutorial 
- Frontend changes
    - Tailwind instead of Bootstrap
    - DaisyUI, Tailwind component library.
    - UI/UX changes
    - Vite instead of Create React app
- Git version control
